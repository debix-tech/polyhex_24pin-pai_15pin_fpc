## Safety Instruction and Warnings:
- The FPC connectors and the cable ends are extremely delicate. Apply force only directly on the connector bodies, not the cable or the locking tabs. Misalignment or excessive force can bend pins, crack solder joints, or break the connector housing.
- Always completely power down the DEBIX board and disconnect any power sources before inserting or removing this FPC cable or the connected camera module.
- Avoid exposure to water, moisture, and conductive surfaces while operating.
- Store the cable flat or loosely coiled in a clean, dry, temperature-controlled environment away from direct sunlight, dust, moisture, and chemicals. Avoid placing heavy 
objects on top of it.
